# graph-parser
A C++ graph structure parser. Delimited by commas. Parser processes input .csv file for roots(0 inbound edges), leaves(0 outbound edges, and self nodes(self pointing nodes). An assignment given by S. Healy at SDSU.

# Keynotes:

-uses OOP in C++ to process csv files

-Some algorithms may not be optimized, but the assignment was focused on figuring out how to use C++ classes to achieve solution
